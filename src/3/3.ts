/* CHALLENGE 1
 *
 * Vanilla JavaScript is magnitudes faster than frameworks like React
 * but there are tricks to make Vanilla JavaScript go even faster!
 *
 * Accessing elements on the DOM is expensive. You don't want to search the DOM
 * too frequently. There's a game development trick that uses lazy initialization
 * to search the DOM for elements and store their pointers/handles somewhere(in
 * variables, of course) for later use. Whenever there's a need to access the
 * element, you can use use the already initialized handle rather than querying the DOM.
 *
 *
 * PROBLEM:
 *
 * Assume there's a div element with an id of "id". You are to lazyily grab
 * hold of this element.
 *
 * HINT:
 * checkout Singleton desing pattern
 *
 *
 * Function signature
 * - name: lazyElement
 * - parameters: none
 * - return type: HTMLElement
 *
 * When you are done, uncomment the test marked "CHALLENGE 1" in ./3.test.ts
 */

export function lazyElement(): HTMLElement | null {
  var id = document.getElementById("id");
  return id;
}

/*
 * Please ignore.
 *
 * TypeScript modules can't be empty. This is hack to overcome that limitation

export {};
